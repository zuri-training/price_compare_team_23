# Adam Documentation

I am Adam Ibrahim. I was assigned initially to develop the product details page for our website, and I visited the figma board for the product details design and I noticed that to achieve the functionality on the design I would have to use a frontend framework (React.js) which was successful and have a wonderful experience. Which I made a live server video that posted my team Whatsapp group for their opinion. 

[Video before using REACT](https://github.com/zuri-training/price_compare_team_23/blob/main/addexdi/VID-20220810-WA0007.mp4) and [video after using REACT on the project](https://github.com/zuri-training/price_compare_team_23/blob/main/addexdi/VID-20220810-WA0014.mp4) which concludes me been done with the page.

After a few days the product details page design received some new updates (changes). The updates made by the designers was implemented and React.js was no longer required [video to the new implementations](https://github.com/zuri-training/price_compare_team_23/blob/main/addexdi/product%20details%20page.mp4)

I was giving three extra new pages to develop
