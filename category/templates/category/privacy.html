        <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
        <h5>Your Privacy Rights</h5>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes your privacy rights regarding
          our collection, use, storage, sharing, and protection of your personal
          information. It governs your participation on the
          eBayCommerceNetwork.com, Shopping.com and DealTime.com websites
          (including the versions of these sites in foreign jurisdictions),
          their sister sites, and all co-branded versions of these sites or any
          successor brand that eBay may designate from time to time in its
          discretion (in the United States or foreign jurisdictions), which are
          referred to collectively as the "eBay Commerce Network" or "ECN,"
          along with their related sites, applications, services, and tools,
          regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile
          devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          You accept this Privacy Policy when you sign up for, access, or use
          our products, services, content, features, technologies, or functions
          offered on our websites and all related sites, applications, and
          services (collectively "eBay Commerce Network Services").
        </p>

        <p>
          We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended
          terms on this site. Any such amendment shall take effect when such
          amendment is sent by email or posted on the eBay Commerce Network.
          Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term "personal information"
          to describe information that can be associated with a specific person
          and could be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal
          information to include information that has been made anonymous or
          aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination
          with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.
        </p>

        <h5>Scope and Consent</h5>
        <p>

          By using the ECN websites or their related applications, services, and
          tools, or by registering for an account with any of our websites, you

          and storage of your personal information to our servers in the United
          States and elsewhere in the world where we have facilities.

        <h5>Global Privacy Standards</h5>
        <p>
          In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy,
          eBay Inc. has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to
          as "Binding Corporate Rules" or "BCRs"), which are our global privacy
          standards for all eBay Inc. companies.
        </p>

        <p>
          These BCRs have been approved by a number of European Union privacy
          regulators. They are a commitment by eBay Inc. to protect your
          personal information and honor our privacy obligations regardless of
          where your personal information is collected, processed, or stored.
          Depending on where you reside, the BCRs may also provide you some
          additional privacy rights through your local privacy regulator or
          court.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more information about our BCRs and our global privacy practices
          and principles, including information on how to contact us with any
          questions, visit our eBay Privacy Center.

          or use our applications, services, and tools using a mobile device,
