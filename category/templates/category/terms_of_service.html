            <h4>Terms of Service</h4>
            <h5>Thanks for choosing ShopMore.com</h5>

By using ShopMore or any ShopMore services, you are agreeing to these terms. Be sure to occasionally check back for updates.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>To access and use the Services, you must register for a Shopmore  account (“Account”). To complete your Account registration, you must provide us with your full legal name, business address, phone number, a valid email address, and any other information indicated as required. Shopmore may reject your application for an Account, or cancel an existing Account, for any reason, at our sole discretion.</li>

                </li>
                <li>4.

You must monitor the Primary Email Address you provide to Shopmore and your Primary Email Address must be capable of both sending and receiving messages. Your email communications with Shopmore can only be authenticated if they come from your Primary Email Address.</li>
                <li>5. You are responsible for keeping your password secure. Shopmore cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to maintain the security of your Account and password.
                </li>
                <li>6. Technical support in respect of the Services is only provided to Shopmore Users. Questions about the Terms of Service should be sent to Shopmore Support.</li>
                <li>7. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission by Shopmore.</li>
                <li>8. You agree not to work around, bypass, or circumvent any of the technical limitations of the Services, including to process orders outside Shopmore’s Checkout, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the Services, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Services.</li>
                <li>9. You agree not to access the Services or monitor any material or information from the Services using any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means.</li>
                <li>10. You understand that your Materials may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. “Materials” means Your Trademarks, copyright content, any products or services you sell through the Services (including description and price), and any photos, images, videos, graphics, written content, audio files, code, information, or other data provided or made available by you or your affiliates to Shopify or its affiliates.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>2. Account Activation</h5>
            <p>The person signing up for the Service by opening an Account will be the contracting party (“Store Owner ”) for the purposes of our Terms of Service and will be the person who is authorized to use any corresponding Account we may provide to the Store Owner in connection with the Service. You are responsible for ensuring that the name of the Store Owner (including the legal name of the company that owns the Store, if applicable) is clearly visible on the Store’s website.</p>
            <p>If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer, your employer will be the Store Owner. If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer, then you must use your employer-issued email address and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind your employer to our Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>Your Shopmore Store can only be associated with one Store Owner. A Store Owner may have multiple Shopmore Stores. You agree to use Shopmore Checkout for your store. “Store” means the online store (whether hosted by Shopify or on a third party website), or any storefront built on top of the Storefront API or physical retail location(s) associated with the Account.</p>

            <h5>3. Shopmore Rights</h5>
            <p>The Services have a range of features and functionalities. Not all Services or features will be available to all Merchants at all times and we are under no obligation to make any Services or features available in any jurisdiction. Except where prohibited in these Terms of Service or by applicable law, we reserve the right to modify the Services or any part thereof for any reason, without notice and at any time.</p>

            <p>Shopify does not pre-screen Materials and it is in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any Materials from any part of the Services, including if we determine in our sole discretion that the goods or services that you offer through the Services, or the Materials uploaded or posted to the Services, violate our AUP or these Terms of Service.</p>
                
            <p>Verbal or written abuse of any kind (including threats of abuse or retribution) of any Shopify employee, member, or officer will result in immediate Account termination.</p>

            <p> We reserve the right to provide our Services to your competitors and make no promise of exclusivity. You further acknowledge and agree that Shopify employees and contractors may also be Shopify customers or merchants and that they may compete with you, although they may not use your Confidential Information (as defined in Section 6) in doing so.</p>
            
            <p>In the event of a dispute regarding Account ownership, we reserve the right to request documentation to determine or confirm Account ownership. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a scanned copy of your business license, government issued photo ID, the last four digits of the credit card on file, or confirmation of your status as an employee of an entity.</p>
            
            <p>Shopify reserves the right to determine, in our sole discretion, rightful Account ownership and transfer an Account to the rightful Store Owner. If we are unable to reasonably determine the rightful Store Owner, without prejudice to our other rights and remedies, Shopify reserves the right to temporarily suspend or disable an Account until resolution has been determined between the disputing parties.</p>

            <h5>3. Your Responsibilities</h5>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree to provide public-facing contact information, a refund policy and order fulfilment timelines on your Shopmore Store.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge and agree that the Services are not a marketplace, and any contract of sale made through the Services is directly between you and the customer. You are the seller of record for all items you sell through the Services. You are responsible for the creation and operation of your Shopmore Store, your Materials, the goods and services that you may sell through the Services, and all aspects of the transactions between you and your customer(s). This includes, but is not limited to, authorizing the charge to the customer in respect of the customer’s purchase, refunds, returns, fulfilling any sales or customer service, fraudulent transactions, required legal disclosures, regulatory compliance, alleged or actual violation of applicable laws (including but not limited to consumer protection laws in any jurisdiction where you offer products or services for sale), or your breach of these Terms of Service. You represent and warrant that your Store, your Materials and the goods and services you sell through the Services will be true, accurate, and complete, and will not violate any applicable laws, regulations or rights of third parties. For the avoidance of doubt, Shopmore will not be the seller or merchant or record and will have no responsibility for your Store or items sold to customers through the Services.</p>
            
            <p>You are solely responsible for the goods or services that you may sell through the Services (including description, price, fees, tax that you calculate, defects, required legal disclosures, regulatory compliance, offers or promotional content), including compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
            
            <p>You may not use the Shopmore Services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws), the laws applicable to you in your customer’s jurisdiction, or the laws of Canada and the Province of Ontario. You will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to obtaining and complying with the requirements of any license or permit that may be necessary to operate your store or that may be held by you) in your use of the Service and your performance of obligations under the Terms of Service.</p>
            
            <p>The API Terms govern your access to and use of the Shopify API (as defined therein). You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs using your API Credentials (as defined in the API Terms) and for keeping your API Credentials secure.</p>
            
            <p>You agree to use Shopify Checkout for any sales associated with your online store. “Shopify Checkout” means Shopify’s checkout experience that allows Customers to enter their shipping information and payment details after adding item(s) to their cart and before placing an order, including checkouts that occur through the Shopify Checkout API.</p>

            <h5>4. Payment of Fees and Taxes</h5>
            <p>You will pay the Fees applicable to your subscription to Online Service and/or POS Services (“Subscription Fees”) and any other applicable fees, including but not limited to applicable fees relating to the value of sales made through your Store when using all payment providers other than Shopify Payments (“Transaction Fees”), and any fees relating to your purchase or use of any products or services such as Shopmore Payments, POS Equipment, shipping, apps, Themes, domain names, Experts Marketplace, or Third Party Services (“Additional Fees”). Together, the Subscription Fees, Transaction Fees and the Additional Fees are referred to as the “Fees”.</p>
            
            <p>You must keep a valid payment method on file with us to pay for all incurred and recurring Fees. Shopmore will charge applicable Fees to any valid payment method that you authorize (“Authorized Payment Method”), and Shopmore will continue to charge the Authorized Payment Method for applicable Fees until the Services are terminated, and any and all outstanding Fees have been paid in full. Unless otherwise indicated, all Fees and other charges are in U.S. dollars, and all payments will be in U.S. currency.</p>

            <p>Subscription Fees are paid in advance and will be billed in 30 day intervals (each such date, a “Billing Date”). Transaction Fees and Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at Shopmore discretion. You will be charged on each Billing Date for all outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged. Fees will appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the Store Owner via the Primary Email Address provided. As well, an invoice will appear on the Account page of your Store’s administrative console. Users have approximately two weeks to bring up and settle any issues with the billing of Subscription Fees.</p>
            
            <p>If we are not able to process payment of Fees using an Authorized Payment Method, we will make a second attempt to process payment using any Authorized Payment Method, typically 14 days later, but Shopmore may attempt sooner. If the second attempt is not successful, we will make a final attempt, typically 14 days following the second attempt, but in certain circumstances Shopify may do this second attempt sooner. If our final attempt is not successful, we may suspend and revoke access to your Account and the Services. Your Account will be reactivated upon your payment of any outstanding Fees, plus the Fees applicable to your next billing cycle. You may not be able to access your Account or your storefront during any period of suspension. If the outstanding Fees remain unpaid for 60 days following the date of suspension, Shopmore reserves the right to terminate your Account in accordance with Section 14.</p>

            <p>All Fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services (including Goods and Sales Tax under the Goods and Services Tax Act, Chapter 117A of Singapore), harmonized or other taxes, fees or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“Taxes”).</p>
            
            <p>You are responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from or as a result of your subscription to or purchase of Shopmore’s products and services. To the extent that Shopmore charges these Taxes, they are calculated using the tax rates that apply based on the billing address you provide to us. Such amounts are in addition to the Fees for such products and services and will be billed to your Authorized Payment Method. If you are exempt from payment of such Taxes, you must provide us with evidence of your exemption, which in some jurisdictions includes an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive evidence satisfactory to Shopmore of your exemption. If you are not charged Taxes by Shopmore, you are responsible for determining if Taxes are payable, and if so, self-remitting Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities in your jurisdiction.</p>
                
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to Shopmore under these Terms of Service will be paid free and clear of any deductions or withholdings whatsoever. Other than Taxes charged by Shopify to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on your behalf, any deductions or withholdings that are required by law will be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant taxation authority. Shopify will be entitled to charge the full amount of Fees stipulated under these Terms of Service to your Authorized Payment Method ignoring any such deduction or withholding that may be required.</p>

            <p>You are solely responsible for determining, collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting applicable taxes, duties, fees, surcharges and additional charges that arise from or as a result of any sale on your Shopify Store or your use of the Services. The Services are not a marketplace. Any contract of sale made through the Services is directly between you and the customer.</p>
            
            <p>You must maintain an accurate location in the administrative console of your Shopify Store. If you change jurisdictions you must promptly update your location in the administrative console.</p>
            
            <p>Shopify does not provide refunds.</p>
            
            <h5>5. Confidentiality</h5>

            <p>“Confidential Information” will include, but will not be limited to, any and all information associated with a party’s business and not publicly known, including specific business information, technical processes and formulas, software, customer lists, prospective customer lists, names, addresses and other information regarding customers and prospective customers, product designs, sales, costs (including any relevant processing fees), price lists, and other unpublished financial information, business plans and marketing data, and any other confidential and proprietary information, whether or not marked as confidential or proprietary. Shopify’s Confidential Information includes all information that you receive relating to us, or to the Services, that is not known to the general public including information related to our security program and practices.</p>

            <p>Each party agrees to use the other party’s Confidential Information solely as necessary for performing its obligations under these Terms of Service and in accordance with any other obligations in these Terms of Service including this Section 6. Each party agrees that it will take all reasonable steps, at least substantially equivalent to the steps it takes to protect its own proprietary information, to prevent the duplication, disclosure or use of any such Confidential Information, other than (i) by or to its employees, agents and subcontractors who must have access to such Confidential Information to perform such party’s obligations hereunder, who each will treat such Confidential Information as provided herein, and who are each subject to obligations of confidentiality to such party that are at least as stringent as those contained herein; or (ii) as required by any law, regulation, or order of any court of proper jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter contained in these Terms of Service, provided that, if legally permitted, the receiving party will give the disclosing party prompt written notice and use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such disclosure is accorded confidential treatment. Confidential Information will not include any information that the receiving party can prove: (A) was already in the public domain, or was already known by or in the possession of the receiving party, at the time of disclosure of such information; (B) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the other party’s Confidential Information, and without breaching any provisions of these Terms of Service; or (C) is thereafter rightly obtained by the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party without breaching any provision of these Terms of Service.</p>

            <h5>6. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification</h5>
            <p>You expressly understand and agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, Shopmore and its suppliers will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses arising out of or relating to the use of or inability to use the Service or these Terms of Service (however arising, including negligence).</p>

            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, Shopmore partners, officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents it incorporates by reference (including the AUP); (b) or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or (c) any aspect of the transaction between you and your Customer, including but not limited to refunds, fraudulent transactions, alleged or actual violation of applicable laws (including but not limited to Federal and State consumer protection laws), or your breach of the Terms of Service.</p>

            <p>You will be responsible for any breach of the Terms of Service by your affiliates, agents or subcontractors and will be liable as if it were your own breach.</p>

            <p>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. The Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.</p>
                
            <p>Shopmore does not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</p>

            <p>Shopmore does not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services will be accurate or reliable.</p>

            <p>Shopmore is not responsible for any of your tax obligations or liabilities related to the use of Shopify’s Services.</p>

            <p>Shopmore does not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other materials purchased or obtained by you through the Services will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the Services will be corrected.</p>
            
            <h5>7. Feedback and Reviews</h5>

            <p>Shopmore welcomes any ideas and/or suggestions regarding improvements or additions to the Services. Under no circumstances will any disclosure of any idea, suggestion or related material or any review of the Services, Third Party Services or any Third Party Provider (collectively, “Feedback”) to Shopify be subject to any obligation of confidentiality or expectation of compensation. By submitting Feedback to Shopify (whether submitted directly to Shopify or posted on any Shopify hosted forum or page), you waive any and all rights in the Feedback and that Shopify is free to implement and use the Feedback if desired, as provided by you or as modified by Shopify, without obtaining permission or license from you or from any third party. Any reviews of a Third Party Service or Third Party Provider that you submit to Shopify must be accurate to the best of your knowledge, and must not be illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable. Shopify reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit Feedback of Third Party Services or Third Party Providers, but does not regularly inspect posted Feedback</p>

            <h5>8. Privacy and Data Protection</h5>

            <p>Shopify is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information and the personal information of your customers. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that Shopify’s collection, usage and disclosure of this personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>To the extent that Shopify processes personal information of your customers as a “data processor” or “service provider” under certain data privacy or protection laws, including the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, Shopify’s collection and use of personal information is also subject to our Data Processing Addendum.</p>
